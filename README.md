# My Homelab
This is my humble attempt at infrastructure as code for my Proxmox server. The goal is to document all the Containers (and possibly VMs in the future) with their respective settings.

### ToDos
- [ ] Start with test-server
- [ ] Migrate currently running servers to the repo
- [ ] document how everything is laid out and how setup works
